### User Stories

- As a user, when I visit the website I see a main welcome page. 

- As a user I will be allowed to pick between three nav options Zodiac Facts, Fortune Teller, Random Advice that once selected take you to their perspective pages. 

- As a user IF I select Random Advice I will be taken to a new page where I retrieve a response from the API 

- As a user IF I select Zodiac Facts I will be taken to a new page where I am shown a card display with all 12 American Zodiac Signs. If I select a card I will be taken to another page where I am given traits and information provided by astrological charts. 

- As a user IF I select Fortune Teller I will be navigated to a new page where I can ask yes or no questions for a response. 

- IF no question is selected I will retrieve an error and a request to do so. 

- As a user, I will be able to navigate back to the main page.
