### User Stories

- As a user, when I visit the website I see a main welcome page. 

- As a user I will be allowed to pick between two nav options Daily Horoscope or Fortune Teller

- As a user I will be navigated to the selected page. IF daily scope is selected I will be brought to a page displaying all American zodiac signs. 

- As a user I am allowed select a sign card which will bring me to a daily horoscope retrieved from an API.

-As a user IF Fortune Teller is selected I will be navigated to another page where a card or preferably a crystal ball will be waiting. 

- As a user I will be prompted to ask a yes or no question. IF no question is selected I will retrieve an error and a request to do so. IF a question is asked I user will be met with the responses Yes, No, The Future is unclear and likely a "You already asked" memory function. 

- As a user, I will be able to navigate back to the main page.
